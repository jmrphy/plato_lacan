### *On Making-Up the Mind: A Political Theory of Plato’s Forms*
 
**Abstract:** In the very beginning of Plato’s *Republic*, Polemarchus and a few associates emerge to
interdict the passage of Socrates and Glaucon as the two are returning home to Athens. When Socrates
asks if he might persuade his interlocutors to let the two Athenians pass, Polemarchus says that his
group simply will not listen, and that Socrates and Glaucon “better make up [their] mind to that
(οὕτω διανοεῖσθε).” The present paper seizes upon this highly enigmatic phrase as a point of
departure for interrogating the relationship between free thought and political power at the
founding of Western political theory. The paper draws on the history of ancient Greek religious
practices and a particular psychoanalytic topology put forward by Jacques Lacan, in order to
demonstrate that this enigmatic and overtly politicized opening of the *Republic* memorializes a
dialectical relationship, always present but repressed, between political forces and the “pure
thought” of philosophical theory. Along these lines it is shown how Plato situates even the very
philosophical high point of the *Republic*, the theory of forms, in a political topology.
