**Abstract:** In the very beginning of Plato’s *Republic*, Polemarchus and a few associates emerge
to interdict the passage of Socrates and Glaucon as the two are returning home to Athens. When
Socrates asks if he might persuade his interlocutors to let the two Athenians pass, Polemarchus says
that his group simply will not listen, and that Socrates and Glaucon “better make up their mind to
that" (οὕτω διανοεῖσθε). The present paper seizes upon this highly enigmatic phrase as a point of
departure for interrogating the relationship between free thought and political power at the
founding of Western political theory. The paper draws on the history of ancient Greek religious
practices and a particular psychoanalytic topology put forward by Jacques Lacan, in order to
demonstrate that this enigmatic and overtly politicized opening of the *Republic* memorializes a
dialectical relationship, always present but repressed, between political forces and the “pure
thought” of philosophical theory. Along these lines it is shown how Plato situates even the very
philosophical high point of the *Republic*, the theory of forms, in a political topology.

#### I. Introduction

In the very beginning of Plato’s *Republic*, Glaucon and Socrates are heading home to Athens.
Polemarchus sees them from a distance and sends a slave to stop them.[^1] When Polemarchus catches
up, he has Adeimantus, Niceratus, and others by his side. Very abruptly, Polemarchus points out that
he has more men in his group, and that Glaucon and Socrates must therefore “prove stronger,” or will
be forced to stay. Socrates asks if there is not a third possibility, namely, that he and Glaucon
persuade the others to let them pass. Polemarchus poses the counter-question: “But could you
persuade us, if we won’t listen?” to which Glaucon replies, “Certainly not.” Polemarchus closes this
discussion with an extremely enigmatic statement: “Well, we won’t listen; you’d better make up your
mind to that” (οὕτω διανοεῖσθε).[^2] Immediately after, Adeimantus describes the enjoyments they can
expect that evening, “persuading” them to stay after they have already been told they have no
choice. Oὕτω διανοεῖσθε is a peculiar phrase. Οὕτω is an adverb, which means “in this way,” and thus
signifies a limitation of some kind, a restriction with an implicitly commanding or imperative
dimension. However, διανοεῖσθε is constructed in the optative mood and means “to be minded,” thus
implying a free choice in the use of the mind. It is a strange syntactical pairing of the
proscriptive/prescriptive with the optative—it seems to suggest a sort of forced freedom.

Furthermore, as if to redouble this tension semantically, διανοεῖσθε contains νόος, mind—the mind of
philosophy and understanding, of logical thought—but begins with δια, a commonly used particle to
denote necessity, the necessity of something in need of doing. “In this way, you two will have to do
with your mind.” The mind will have to do.[^3] Thus, Plato’s language awkwardly combines, on two
different linguistic levels, the connotations of force and free thought. As a result, none of the
English renderings is immediately comprehensible for us. For, what could it mean to “make up one’s
mind” to the fact that one will not be heard? This does not link up clearly to any of the multiple
meanings that for us are attached to the idea of “making up one’s mind.” However, this very gap is
heuristic: because this current expression conserves quite clearly the contradictory construction of
διανοεῖσθε and at the same time is essentially incomprehensible in the context of the *Republic*,
this provides the roadmap of a certain distance—a resistance, if one pleases—that would need to be
traversed to bring this small piece of Plato’s thought into mutual illumination with our own. This
being the present aim, a brief justification may be in order. Will the exegesis not be
disproportionately extensive with respect to this passing remark in what is not yet even the
substantive dialogue?

First, one must be immediately struck by the quite sudden and apparently arbitrary politicization
this exchange represents. Especially because Adeimantus is Glaucon’s brother, the introduction of
the question of force here seems rather contrived. One might read the inorganicism of this
question’s appearance as an indication that something important must be addressed straightaway, a
sacrifice of organic narrativity which must serve another function. Second, beyond this vague hint,
in some sense the whole subsequent dialogue has this injunction to “make up one’s mind” as its very
condition of possibility and can be read as responding to its call, because otherwise Glaucon and
Socrates would have simply returned home never encountering the conditions for the production of the
*Republic*’s ideas. My reading seeks to confirm that both the inorganicism and early placement of
this seemingly unnecessary and merely rhetorical prelude are both called for by the very argument
that this scenario dramatizes.

#### II. Desire and Theory in *The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psychoanalysis*

Jacques Lacan writes the following:

> I maintain that it is at the level of analysis—if we can take a few more steps
forward— that the nodal point by which the pulsation of the unconscious is
linked to sexual reality must be revealed. This nodal point is called desire,
and the theoretical elaboration that I have pursued in recent years will show
you through each stage of clinical experience, how desire is situated in
dependence on demand—which, by being articulated in signifiers, leaves a
metonymic remainder that runs under it, an element that is not indeterminate,
which is a condition both, absolute and unapprehensible, an element necessarily
lacking, unsatisfied, impossible, misconstrued, an element that is called
desire.[^4]
 
Instead of trying to unpack this systematically—for, Lacan is not our focus, and in any event his
texts are unreadable in his own technical sense—let us rather take it as an epigram, a provocation,
a bank of vocabulary. A demand is an injunction directed to another, and as a receipt or claim on
the desire of the other, it seems quite clear from the beginning that the psychic economy of an
individual understood in this way locates the individual in a social scenario that is irreducibly
political- economic. That is, if desire only functions in dependence on demand, the economy of
desire between persons is an economy of scarcity, based as it is on individuals who, as speaking
beings, cannot say everything at once and must therefore make distributional decisions in speech,
but who are also players in a zero-sum game insofar as desires between persons simply conflict. What
a subject will articulate/signify is a choice always made with respect to the aims of a desire among
other conceivable desires and is therefore always the function of a particular distribution of
energy among other alternative and forsaken distributions: a political decision. But the absolute
and also inapprehensible metonymic remainder of the subject’s articulations introduce a second site
of psychic politics: the inescapable condition of articulation is the dissimulation or repression of
the very basic, primordial violence of language’s entrance onto the scene.

One would never get around to venturing the primordial word if one waited for permission, a
justification, a reason-in- advance of reason. The commonplace dialectical paradox of political
theory, that the state is logically and empirically founded on the criminal act of its
institution—logically because the founding act is external to the state’s laws which are only
established after the fact, and often semi-empirically, for example, with Romulus’s legendary murder
and the founding of Rome—finds a perfect parallel in language, or what I would like to call very
broadly the theoretical as such (to accent the basic continuity between high theory and everyday
practices of signification.) The theoretical is founded on a homologous primordial violence and
continues through a homologous repression/dissimulation of that violence. In other words, not only
does desire imply forsaken desires, but as speaking beings our articulations imply one of the
politician’s greatest pastimes: the “cover- up,” in which an action that appears at the time
practically necessary and desirable but theoretically (or legally) objectionable demands further
objectionable actions to keep off the surface the original criminal act and also sustain the
desirable practical necessity. We continue to speak to cover up the unsatisfied, impossible,
unapprehensible lack which motivated our first utterance.[^5]

In politics, we endure while continually revising our management of the profits and losses incurred
in the primal political scene by new innovations in the status quo (small to large killings of the
father, from mundane legislation to revolutions) and we enjoy their successes and atone for their
failures in a way that dissimulates their reality no less than primitives and neurotics. In the
theoretical, we find the same structure. The history of the theoretical is a history of the
management of a theoretical ambivalence, between the enjoyments and gains made possible only with
the pre-theoretical breach of articulation and a moral consciousness we have become cognizant of
only because of the original cut into the world by signification. This, then, establishes in a very
preliminary way the basic coordinates of my interest in the *Republic*: the political-economic
character of both the personal and interpersonal management of desire; the repressive dimension
common to political action and theoretical articulation (what we can now call, properly, the
unconscious of each); in general, a very basic structural homology between the political, the
theoretical, and the economy of desire.

When Polemarchus makes his odd suggestion/injunction, he evokes this whole set of problems with
remarkable efficiency. The root of διανοεῖσθε is διανοέοµαι, which contains the well-known nous, and
means "be minded of, purpose, or intention."[^6] To be minded of: to have something in mind, but
also to have the mind forced by the object of attention into its attention. And, of course, this is
precisely what is going on between Polemarchus and Socrates. Socrates has to make up his mind about
Polemarchus, consider the situtation, play with it in his mind theoretically, etc., but only because
the desire of Polemarchus presses, oppresses and we can even say represses that mind. Theory is both
repressed and repressing. It is repressed by the objects of its attention, the desire of the other
that is its calling and whatever its particular fascination might be, and it is repressing because,
in order to function as sound reason, it must keep off the record the founding violence of its
intellectually arbitrary distributive choices (to privilege theorizing over doing something else,
for instance) in its logically arbitrary origination. That is, the mind cannot simply mind itself in
a pure movement of justified reason, just like a state cannot found itself in a pure movement of
already legal legislation.

This is what explains Plato’s paradoxical construction, which suggests a forced “making” or doing of
the free mind. Plato is pointing us toward theory’s obscene, and from its own standpoint, absolutely
intolerable condition of possibility: that pure reason and truth are founded on a situation
thoroughly mediated by an interpersonal negotiation of desire, i.e. the free-thinking mind of
philosophical thought is made possible by what, according to its own canons, is a crime: a vulgar,
practical necessity laced with selfish aims and opaque strategies. And of course Plato’s own
strategy in pointing this out to us is no less opaque and must be achieved only by the most oblique
condensation of equivocal meanings. This is why it must not be objected against the present reading
that I am making too much ado about such a small and insignificant portion of the text. If this
little passage has been overlooked, it is no wonder. For the text to get off the ground, it is
necessary that it be overlooked at first, only there to be reconsidered, at best, in ambiguous
hindsight. For, what it announces, if taken too far toward the limit of the truth it hints at—the
founding impurity of pure philosophical speculation which shows its essential lie—would be the
text’s own invalidation.

Thus, we can understand this initial scenario as a metatheoretical gloss on the analogy between soul
and city that is quite appropriately oblique, suspicious, and dissimulated insofar as it cannot
escape the economies of repression that belong homologously to both the theory of politics and the
politics of theory. It is the metatheoretical statement of the *Republic* insofar as it comments, by
a remarkably multi-vocal dramatic enaction, on the originary and multi- directional violence of
philosophical thought. The homology between the political management of psychic desire in speech
(the theoretical) and socially conflicting desires among individuals (the profanely political) can
be hypothesized as the justification for the analogy between the soul and the city. We can now more
confidently build on this analogy for developing the implications of the homology between the
politics of theory and the theory of politics.

#### III. The Structure of Theory in the *Republic*

Andrea Wilson Nightingale has shown very well that Plato draws heavily on the civic and religious
traditions of theoria in order to constitute what is, at the time the *Republic* is written, the new
practice of philosophical theoria.[^7] Indeed, she suggests that the *Republic*, of all dialogues,
leans on traditional social forms of theoria “especially clearly.”[^8] She observes that Socrates
and Glaucon, in the opening scenario, are returning from a “theoric event,” the festival of Bendis.
As she emphasizes, the establishing function of this theoric event is tightly integrated into the
text, particularly in its anticipation of the metaphysical theoria developed in books V- VIII.

As a result of this debt to traditional forms of theoria, in Plato’s *Republic* one can plot quite
rigorously what I will call a “theoric structure.” In the parallels between traditional forms of
theoria and Plato’s philosophical theoria, we have the material to sketch this structure and,
particularly by thinking more seriously about desire, put forward some quite significant
conclusions. To anticipate, this theoric structure consists in three elements: 1.) the desire for a
particular kind of knowledge, which leads to 2.) a confrontation with the object of that knowledge,
and 3.) the problem of bringing that knowledge back in the form a “return account.” This much is
already clear in accounts such as the one provided by Nightingale, but a few new points will have to
be brought into focus. Namely and in short, the theoric flight, although it seeks knowledge or
truth, takes off and lands on decidedly politicized runways. The point of departure is invariably a
function of competing desires, and the return account is always compromised by the political reality
of the desires into which it must integrate itself. Furthermore, even in his confrontation with the
object of his theoric desire, it can be shown that the theoros always comes up short or just misses
his object. Finally and perhaps most interestingly, we will have to note what is retained as the
signifier of this lost object.

##### Religious and Diplomatic Theoria

In the case of religious theoria, the theoros is most often on an oracular mission desiring, and
himself a function of others’ desires for, divine knowledge. The theoros is sent by a city to
consult an oracle, perform the relevant rituals, have the consultation,and return home to provide an
account of what was said by the oracle. Almost needless to say, the theoroi sent to oracles were
mostly from the aristocratic classes. More interestingly, the issue of funding such theoric ventures
were explicitly political. If not to an oracle, a theoros might be sent to a religious festival for
the same purpose, and with the same expectations. As Nightingale notes, the latter form of religious
theoria was as political as it was religious, insofar as the theoroi were most often aristocrats
sent as representatives of their city.[^9] In this variation, we are dealing with what is basically
a diplomatic mission. As we will see, there is another political dimension to this form of theoros
in that the content of the return account would by definition be a comparative political assessment
of one’s home city, favorable or unfavorable.

Even apart from an implicit political critique implied in a comparative view, messages right from
the mouth of an oracle could be a significant political liability for the theoros, as in Oedipus
Tyrannus.[^10] Part of the expectation for oracular missions was a scrupulous emphasis on the
faithfulness of the return account, an insistence that one not “add anything,” nor “take anything
away,” from the “sacred pronouncement.”[^11] However, there are several indications that this
emphasis only testifies to the marked impossibility of such a pure account. In fact, it is much like
the dialectical paradox of the rule and its transgression: the prohibition does not testify to the
abhorrence of a certain action, but an intimate sense of desire for its execution.

First, that the whole point of visiting an oracle is to bear witness to something with one’s own
eyes as opposed to just hearing an account,[^12] already indicates an inherent inadequacy, an
invariable gap in the completeness of the most articulate return account. Secondly, oracular truth
was never something to be recorded and transmitted, but it rather consisted in a ritualistic
practice, what Elsner calls “ritual-centered visuality.”[^13] This visuality supported by practical,
ceremonial supports, keeps the theoros from “interpreting images through the rules and desires of
everyday life. It constructs a ritual barrier to the identification and objectifications of the
screen of [social] discourse and posits a sacred possibility for vision.”[^14] In this way, too, the
divine vision is from the start not susceptible to a faithful return account, insofar as the
practical ritual conditions cannot be simply replicated at home in a do-it-yourself manner. Finally,
although Nightingale cites the Ion for its rendering of what a return account looks like, she does
not notice the irony: in the excessively “vivid detail” of the chorus’s description of the Oracle at
Delphi, and also in the chorus’s comparison of the Delphic sculptures to the ones with which they
are familiar from home, can we not see a note of mockery at the expectation, proffered by the likes
of Theognis, of an absolute fidelity in the return account?

##### Personal Theoria

In the case of theoria as a search for wisdom, the theoros undertakes the work of personal
cultivation to obtain a personal kind of knowledge or wisdom. The theoros would journey abroad
simply for the sake of learning. Through Herodotus, Nightingale highlights Solon, who privately
traveled abroad for ten years, “wandering” in the name of “intellectual cultivation.”[^15] Instances
of personal self- cultivation with political sponsorship, it appears, are not necessarily without
religious and diplomatic dimensions.

Anarcharsis, interestingly, was sent to Greece by the king of Scythia and after studying Greek
religious practices, he attempted to introduce some of the Greek religious practices into Scythian
religious culture. The king of Scythia then shot and killed him with an arrow for this attempted
importation of foreign ways, and the Scythian people then disclaimed all knowledge of
Anacharsis.[^16]

The life of Socrates also followed the theoric trajectory as an instance of personal theoria,
distinct from the discipline of philosophy as Plato would later conceive it. Socratic skepticism,
which consists in knowing that one knows nothing, was only a negative knowledge, a limiting
knowledge used for the maintenance of one’s own soul. Socrates’ practical efforts to provide an
account of what he learned were limited to extreme modesty and ironic detachment, and critique of
others’ claims and arguments. The benefit or gain of Socratic dialectic was only to be found in
Socrates’ inner peace, and it is well known that his minor forays into practical conversion or
positive intellectual production, his “corrupting of the youth,” ended in dramatic political
failure.

##### The Theoria of Dying

The Myth of Er, which concludes the *Republic*, follows the same structure. Er participates in
military battle as the practical access point to knowledge of the afterlife. Plato narrates how Er
is killed in battle, travels to the afterlife, but then awakes to give an account of what he
witnessed to the people of his home city. The place of the afterlife, revealingly, is described
precisely as a religious festival, and there he is given an injunction to bring home to mankind
everything he witnesses there.[^17] When he entered the afterlife, he was instructed to “listen to
and look at everything in the place” because he was to be a “messenger to human beings about the
things that were there.”[^18] However, just as in the other kinds of theoria, Plato in at least two
ways highlights that “everything in the place” is certainly not reported.

First of all, the sheer breadth and depth of what Er is given to perceive in the afterlife almost
leads one to think that what Er is perceiving is Everything itself. That is, the fantastic ensemble
Plato describes, between the notoriously difficult “light and spindle” to the lives of men which are
laid out (…all the other things were there, mixed with each other and with wealth, poverty,
sickness, health, and to the states intermediate to them) seem to represent nothing less than
absolute totality plain and simple. If the experiential content of Er’s visit to the afterlife is
absolute totality itself, than Er’s task of reporting “everything in the place” is like the “vivid
detail” of the *Ion*, an insistence on a completely comprehensive description of an experience that
is at the same time understood to be impossibly rich.

Secondly, one finds another peculiar statement in this portion of the text which has the same
functional significance of the narrative prelude which introduces Socrates and Glaucon in the
beginning of the text. Plato tells us that Er “said some other things about the stillborn and those
who had only lived for a short time, but they’re not worth recounting.” Apparently, this is an
absolutely trivial statement. But we must be permitted to wonder: Why, if these things are not worth
recounting, is it worth it for Plato to recount that they are not worth recounting? It seems
perfectly fair to suggest that it is worth recounting for Plato because it is in fact essential to
recall that logos faces ineluctable distributive choices, or in other words, that the giving of an
account is subject to an economy that cannot be ignored.

There is one final note of interest in the theoric structure of the myth of Er. Socrates introduces
the story with the following disclaimer. “It isn’t, however, a tale of Alcinous that I’ll tell you
but that of a brave Pamphylian man called Er, the son of Armenias, who once died in a war.” As
pointed out in the editor’s notes, Plato seems to be punning on the Greek word for “brave,” alkimou.
For, the tales of Alcinous in Books 9-11 of the Odyssey are known as Alkinou apologoi. Therefore, if
alkimou can be read as combining alke (strength) and nous (understanding), alkimou can be read as
combining alke and Mousa, muse. [^19] In other words, it is not a tale of strong logical
understanding, but rather a tale of strong storytelling. It is obvious that Plato, in recounting a
myth, is telling a strong story, and this is certainly what has served to justify this particular
interpretation of the pun.[^20] But because the figure of Er, in Plato’s story, is also an assigned
“messenger,” one can just as well suggest that he, not Plato, is the strong storyteller. In fact, it
is even more compelling to understand Er as the object of the pun because the “brave” (alkimou)
character Plato refers to is, after all, Er, not Plato. Of course, we will have every reason to
affirm its applicability to Plato’s own recourse to myth, but it is important for the purpose of
rounding out the terms of the theoric structure that we highlight the pun’s applicability to Er.

This distinction is noticeable and worth mentioning only in the present context because the goal is
to show that the applicability of the pun to Plato’s mythmaking is not just an easy and obvious
conclusion (“of course, Plato is just telling a story,”) but rather the necessary conclusion of a
deeper and more systematic sketch of the theoric structure in its several appearances. That is why
it is necessary to highlight the structural integrity of Er’s theoric trajectory, ending in the
strong storytelling of his tale, rather than stopping short at a reading of the pun which applies to
Plato’s mythmaking only.

##### Philosophical Theoria

In Book V-VII of *Republic*, Plato constructs, for the first time at length, the new, specific
activity of “philosophy,” as something distinct from general intellectual cultivation
(philosophein).[^21] Nightingale shows in great detail how the philosopher is constructed on the
grounds of traditional theoria. The Allegory of the Cave, for instance, is the story of a theoric
pilgrimage from shadow to light and back into shadow. The desire of he who leaves the cave differs
from mere personal cultivation in that the philosophical theoros seeks not to “wander” so as to work
on the self, but to see being as it really is, to see it in its truth unadulterated by the shadows
of personal desires, biases, illusions, etc., in order to bring it back into the cave.[^22] This
would be the difference between wisdom and philosophical truth: the first is negative, a peeling
away of excesses, biases, and illusions for the improvement of one’s soul; the second is a positive
acquisition or production intended for the reception of others. The error of Anarchasis, or Socrates
for that matter, was to make a politically inept production of their acquired wisdom. As we will
see, this also marks the difference between Socrates and Plato and can be read as a foundational
concern of the *Republic* itself.

##### Generalizing the Structure of Theoria

If we wished to represent the structure of theoria graphically, as Plato gave us to understand it,
we would have to show thought "ascending" from earthly obviousness to a better-lit plateau, followed
by the descent back “down to earth,” to “reality.” Here, each particular element in each particular
kind of theoria—Plato’s own as they appear on the narrative level of his text, and the traditional
institutions of theoria as Nightingale has reconstructed them out of his text—are clustered and
plotted to represent the general trajectory of theoria as it appears in the *Republic*.
 
![**Figure 1. Theoric structure in *Republic***](figure_1_theoric_structure.png)

In each case there is, to begin with, a set of practical conditions or in other words a particular
institution—a more or less distinct and stable desire (more: religious theoria; less: philosophical
theoria, which is for Greek philosophy radically insecure) propped up by some relationship to some
reserve of power or force, be it military might, state funding, or the resources of a lone
individual. This desire takes off, as it were, and is propelled by these resources to an encounter
with some object. What is interesting about this object, designated here as the theoric discovery,
is that in each case the object is not so much a positive attainment, but some finally
insurmountable resistance to the upward theoric flight: mystery, difference, skepticism, limbo, and
blindness, respectively.

On return, the desire of the theoros and the journey it motivated must reintegrate itself into the
practical institutional context from whence it came. As noted, the expectation of this reintegration
is itself a condition of possibility for the theoric journey. But also indicated here, this
reintegration is a negotiated result. It is not determined in the strong sense; there is room for
play, between, for instance, a radical Socratic negativity which maintains fidelity to the truth of
thought’s experience, and a more selective and discreet narrative of the experience.

Constituted by the very shape of the journey, clustered in the negative space underneath the arc of
the way taken, are the positive designations for the contradictory objects which both propel the
journey upward and then repel it downward. These several kinds of knowledge serve to denote the
positive stamp, whether implicitly or explicitly, Plato gives to the invariably elusive object at
the height of the theoric flight. After discussing a similar structure which pertains to the psychic
economy, we will gain additional resources to say more about this theoric economy.

#### IV. The Structure of Drive

In the psychoanalytic understanding, sexual drives must be rigorously distinguished from the animal
instinct, because it is only the latter which take a particular, determinate object. As is well
known, the story of sexual development, as told by the younger Freud, is the story of the infantile
sexual drives (oral, anal, etc.) and their gradual organization at the genital level. Despite
Freud’s early insistence on this tendency of the child’s “polymorphous perversion” to consolidate at
the genital level, Freud later realized, and Lacan emphasized, that this organization always remains
inherently incomplete and precarious at that. Lacan links the partiality of the drives to what he
somewhat ambiguously calls an “economic factor,” implied by the pleasure principle’s relationship to
the Real-Ich, what can be conceptualized as essentially the central nervous system. It must be
remembered that the pleasure-principle has nothing to do with a kind of hedonistic insistence on
simply seeking pleasures, but is rather the reduction of excitations as such, the maintenance of
equilibrium or harmony in the psyche. It is not about pursuing excitations, but about gratifying and
sating excitations so as to get rid of them because they are unpleasurable from the standpoint of
the psyche.

The central nervous system, in maintaining a certain “homeostasis of the internal tensions,”
achieves a minimization of excitations, a containment of energies, and is therefore the pleasure
principle itself. But in the maintenance and containment of these excitations, it is what gives them
the character of a “pressure,” in other words, what accounts for them as unpleasurable. In other
words, it is the maintenance of the homeostasis of the excitations, but a maintenance which, as it
were, runs on the very energy of those excitations. This is why they are partial drives, drives
which find no satisfaction in a final goal or destination, but which only drive out in order to
drive back in. The pleasure principle can be conceptualized as the central nervous system because
each essentially represents this economy, this investment of energy into the maintenance of nothing
other than this investment.
 
   In order to interpret this topology, consider Lacan’s following explanation of the partial drives
in connection to the larger course of life itself: Sexuality is realized only through the operation
of the drives in so far as they are partial drives, partial with regard to the biological finality
of sexuality…If all is confusion in the discussion of the sexual drives it is because one does not
see that the drive represents no doubt, but merely represents, and partially at that, the curve of
fulfillment of sexuality in the living being. Is it surprising that its final term should be death,
when the presence of sex in the living being is bound up with death?[^23]
 
Lacan is referring here to the beyond of the pleasure principle—what Freud referred to as the death
drive. If we could imagine Lacan’s topology of the partial drives with the drive rather going
straight up and reaching a goal beyond its mere point of departure we would have a topology of
animal instinct, death itself for human being. Life is precisely what is sustained by the return and
the repetition of the drives, and in fact is little more, but not nothing more, than this circular
circuit (the central nervous system), in the same sense that a home becomes a home only with its
inhabitants’ repeated returns, and without them remains just a dead empty space. In any event, Lacan
bases his topology of the partial drives on Freud’s use of the three voices (active, reflexive, and
passive) to describe the circuit of the drive. Freud uses the pleasure of seeing as an example. One
sees (active), and from this seeing one is able to see oneself (reflexive). These two voices would
appear, at first glance, to provide a sufficient description of the drive’s circuit, which Freud
tells us is an “outwards- and-back” movement. But Freud notes a third moment in the pleasure of
sight, namely, that in seeing oneself one arrives at a notion of being seen (passive).

![**Figure 2. Lacan's topology of the partial drive**](figure_2_topology_of_drive.png)

Lacan’s interest here is that in this circular circuit, something new emerges. There is suddenly a
subject, not the subject of the drive, but a subject that is other from the subject of the drive,
someone to see the subject of the drive. It was said before that life is little more but not nothing
more than the formalism of a circular circuit because, as Lacan’s topology shows, the critical
feature is what Lacan calls the *objet a*. This *objet a* is not at all the object of the drive as a
particular, determinate bull’s eye, rather it is the name for the hollow space that the drive
creates by not attaining any final satisfaction outside itself. It only comes to be in the drive’s
return into itself without having attained a determinate satisfaction; it is the object of the drive
only known by the fact that when the drive runs its course, it keeps running nonetheless.

This is how humans are distinct from the other species insofar as the object of their drives is not
given, it is not limited and neatly constrained by an automatic instinct as when the fish eats the
minnow that is all there is to it; in the movement of the partial drives which constitute human
being, virtually anything can be occupied by the void within the partial drive, that is, what we
retroactively and only fantastically determine as missing after the drives run their course (what
the mother is trying to understand when she screams to her ceaselessly crying child, “What do you
want from me?”) is up for grabs.

Thus, life is the perpetuity of the partial drive’s circuit. The reason it deserves and necessitates
the designation of “economy” is that it is subject to certain laws of motion which are laws
precisely because the outcome of their violation is no less predicted by the laws: going off the
circular track is conceivable exactly as death, a body torn asunder by an outward expenditure
uncontained, i.e. not reinvested in any apparatus which would maintain the perpetuity of the
energetics.

One last point needs mention before we can begin our return to Plato: the place of the rim. What is
the rim? It is the quelle, the source, of the drive. In short, the rim-like structure of the drive’s
source is implied in the notion of the drive as an excitation, a movement, a deviation from an
equilibrium: as such, it must be seen as a breaking into/out of something back through which it
returns. For the drive to emerge as a concentration, as a particular force rather than total mere
diffusion, there must be a minimal surface against which it finds resistance. This is simply the
Real, defined as obstacle or resistance, the unwelcome.[^24] “It is because of the reality of the
homeostatic system that sexuality comes into play only in the form of partial drives.”[^25] A drive
is what presses through a gap in the Real, but the Real is necessary for the pressure which
constitutes the drive. This is its dialectical character. This will certainly remain ambiguous at
this point, but it is enough to permit moving forward.

If we seem far afield from our concern with Plato and the founding of political philosophy in the
West, we have to elucidate what the partial drive has to do with rationality. Repression, in other
words the very constitution of the partial drives as drives (as opposed to the death drive, the
explosion of the central nervous system in an enjoyment beyond the pleasure principle) is a
signifier insofar as it sets up a subject (here, the Real-Ich becomes an objectified subject)[^26]
for another signifier. This other signifier is, of course, the symptom, the return of the repressed,
which Lacan teaches is homogenous with the repressed and connected to it in what can be conceived as
a scaffolding.[^27]

Opposed to this one extreme of repression as such is not some kind of vulgar hedonistic, excessive
pleasure, but simply interpretation.“Desire, in fact, is interpretation itself.”[^28] The move from
one signifier to another, in other words the search for meaning, the traversal of the scaffolding
which represents the very libidinal investments the returns on which are the perpetuity of life, can
be understood in this sense as an illicit travel into a territory blocked- off by the Real, that is,
structurally blocked off by life and the pleasure principle: every move between signifiers is
unjustified from the standpoint of the pleasure principle, as it represents an excitation which
upsets the equilibrium of any particular moment and the horizon of significations which constitute
it. Interpretation—rather than being on one side with the Real, as in the conception of
interpretation as a search for pure Truth—is opposed to the Real, an obscene and dangerous movement
which moves precisely against the Real.

In between interpertation and the Real, according to Lacan, is sexuality. If the partiality of the
drives did not dominate the “whole economy of this interval,” we could be true prophets. That we are
not mantics indicates sexuality, or the outward-and-backward movements between the primal repressed
and interpretation of the symptom that is a scaffolding built on and run on the pressure of the
primal repressed. The topology of the partial drive illustrates that the desire of a sexed being
does not attain a final satisfaction, but perpetually recreates, by virtue and within the space of
an encircling, a lost object, which retroactively appears as the cause of desire. In other words,
the partiality of the drives (sexuality itself) assures us is that a final interpretative
satisfaction—in, say, the finality of a pure truth, the desire for which we can now understand as
the death drive—is out of the question.

More specifically, it is out of the question precisely because the posing of a question is not what
philosophy all too comfortably imagines it is—a deferral of pleasure, of mere desire, sublimated
into a search for the Real—but rather a violent laceration of the Real (the horizon of present
knowledge as obstacle to some “deeper” meaning located at some other point beyond the horizon) in
the name of desire.

#### V. Conclusion

If we return to our visualization of theoric structure as it appears in Plato’s *Republic*, and we
stand by the premise of the homology between the well-ordered soul and the well-ordered polis, it
would appear that missing from the graphic representation is a source, a quell, or rim- like
structure. If the theoric structure resembles a bow, the curve of fulfillment of human sexuality,
much like the circuit of the partial drive, do we not learn from Lacan’s topology that such a
trajectory cannot, as it were, power itself without the pressure of a Real out of which the theoric
departure would erupt? In other words, what we learn very clearly is that the mind must be made up,
out of a Real which presses on it.

Thought (interpretation, desire) cannot emerge without something which would press the libido, that
is, function as an unpleasurable excitation to be reduced (repressed). The expression of a demand,
for the satisfaction of a particular need, which for speaking beings is articulated in signifiers,
guarantees that there will always be a metonymic remainder as foundation of the scaffolding of
signifiers, the dimension of desire the repression of which serves as the investment of articulating
the demand. When libido is pressed by an unpleasurable excitation, the Real as obstacle, this
pressing creates a pressure or investment which results in the libido’s departure out of a rim- like
structure in the Real.

Whereas attaining a final goal outside of itself would be the death drive, the will to inorganic
thing-like existence, the drives of a sexed being return into themselves as return on the
investment. So it is with the mind and the freethinking subject: the Real presses, builds a
pressure—or, in economic terms, invests itself—into a speaking being, and the being re-presses that
pressure into the production of a truth. This is borne out by the structure of theoria in
*Republic*.

Thus, the self and the city are made up and minded according to the same economics or energetics:
theoretical objects constructed mentally or freely but only possible from the pressure of a
materiality (rim) against which the subject is invested with the desire to think. The desire to free
thinking is only what the pleasure principle demands in response to the Thrasymachean materiality of
being, and free thought or truth is only the outcome of this material investment that being makes in
another, this time speaking, being. Speaking freely is like the steam valve of a pressure cooker:
and it is in this way that the mind is made up, that freedom is forced and is force, but is
nonetheless true insofar as this actually happens.

![**Figure 3. Theoria in terms of drive**](figure_3_theoria_as_drive.png)

This accounts for why Thrasymachus is not theoretically refuted, but effectively defeated. He is not
made to concede that he is wrong, but Plato is able to keep his argument alive and protected by its
own resources. He does this not by proving that he has brought down for Thrasymachus’s view the Form
itself as a positive attainment, but by relating the theory of Forms, the theory which states the
form of Thrasymachus’s theory’s failure, which demonstrates the paradoxical fact that the truth as
the mere empty form of the idea of truth, is a positive force in political progress. It can
forestall anything, and in doing so it reshapes the positive movements forward which happen of
necessity, anyway.

Recall that Socrates and Glaucon are returning from a fairly significant theoric event, heading home
to Athens, when they are captured by Polemarchus and the others. Clearly, in the light of the
preceding remarks, their capture functions on the narrative level of the dialogue according quite
strictly to how Socrates describes “the return” phase of all the other theoric structures he
invokes. That is, returning from a theoric event, he encounters resistance on his return home, a
resistance based on a Thrasymachean advantage of the stronger. Let us emphasize also that the
festival at Bendis was not a trivial affair. The Athenian polis exercised the right to permit or
prohibit forms of worship and the festival to which Glaucon and Socrates refer had the political
significance of being the first Thracian festival permitted in Attica.[^29]

Furthermore, recall what Socrates and Glaucon learned at the Thracian festival in Attica. As it is
said briefly and in passing in the very first lines of the text, the procession of the Thracians was
“no less outstanding” than the “fine one” conducted by the Athenians. It may seem a banal remark,
but as Nightingale points out, Plato goes out of his way to have Socrates voice a non-Athenocentric
viewpoint.[^30] Thus, what he learns from the theoric event is a comparative political knowledge
that conflicts with the patriotism of those back home to whom he will have to provide an account.
That he is returning with a truth that is a political liability supports our emphasis on this
initial framing as invested with the same properties as the other theoric structures.

When Socrates, in the dialogue, encounters the political problem of “selling” the idea of justice to
otherwise selfish people, he takes recourse to myth—to strong stories instead of strong
knowledge.[^31] If we can reasonably posit a structural affinity between the theoric events invoked
throughout the dialogue and the dialogue itself, then going back to the initial scenario reveals the
following.

The injunction that Socrates make up his mind gives us reason to cast across the whole subsequent
dialogue a suspicion of “strong storytelling,” that is, mythmaking or lying. As demonstrated both in
the arguments about the theoros’s return and in the recourse to myth, bringing an account home to an
unjust city is a political liability that requires a political ruse. It is not that the whole
dialogue of the *Republic* is a veiled way of saying that the Thracian procession was just as good
as the Athenian, but that even the apparent triviality—in fact, pure negativity— of this non-
critique that is mere non- Athenocentrism is nonetheless clearly a marker for the place of serious
critique. It might be objected that too much is being made of what is only non- praise and non-
critique of Athens, in calling it a marker for critical political analysis. However, because we are
dealing with the politics of theory, and therefore the repressing and repressed of theory, I think
it is permissible to here to take up another psychoanalytic line. That is, exactly in the
resistance, the muting, the veiling, the trivializing of Socrates’ calling into question of
Athenocentrism is the proof that we are here dealing with dangerous material. Since my argument is
that theoretical conclusions in the *Republic* are understood by Plato to be always politically
problematic, when these theoretical conclusions are dramatized they *ipso facto* cannot be presented
in the full, unrepressed force of their critical potency, and the negativity that Plato uses to
hollow out this positive statement is therefore perfectly revealing of the political problem this
theoretical conclusion represents.

The question that remains is why, if my reading makes sense, would Plato pack so much into
apparently very trivial introductory lines? Everything demonstrated here suggests that the
*Republic* itself, and indeed any transcription of a philosophical realization, can be read as a
“return from the Forms” which always means an encounter with force. Everything indicates that for
Plato there is a constant theoric structure and that Plato and his own texts broadly fit this
structure.

If we conclude that Plato himself would have to adopt the strategy he attributes to Socrates
literally from the first pages to the last, that is, making up his mind—with all of the
reverberations of that phrase—then what does this tell us? All of the ambiguity surrounding the
Forms—that they are not strictly speaking attainable, that they are modeled on mystery—can be
restored a profound coherence at the point we interpret the theory of Forms according to the formula
outlined here. The theory of the Forms is made up, or to be more precise, Plato made up his mind to
them in order to provide a return account of the truth. Of course, a key figure in this equation is
the historical Socrates. Why are the Forms so ontologically and epistemologically mysterious?
Because they are a politicized theory of Socratic negativity, a contrived positivity (content) for
the radical negativity of the truth (form), the pure form of the “I know that I know nothing.”

The theory of Forms is therefore Socratic negativity plus political strategy. The passage that acts
as the narrative condition of possibility for the dialogue of the *Republic* invokes a Socrates that
is different from the historical Socrates precisely in that he is politically shrewd; in the face of
capture, he provides a politically palatable form for the irreducibility of dialectic by positing
the idealism that sustains it. By inserting himself into this ideology as an interlocutor, he is
able to execute the logical parlor trick called Justice in order to subvert the reality of
Thrasymachean advantage.

promiscuous sexual reign. The brothers must then endure, through to the present day, the ambivalent
tension between happiness for their freedom and remorse for their crime.
